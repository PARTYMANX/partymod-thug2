# PARTYMOD for THUG2
This is a patch for THUG2 to improve its input handling as well as smooth out a few other parts of the PC port.
The patch is designed to keep the game as original as possible, and leave its files unmodified.

Shoutouts to gone and the ClownJob'd patch that inspired much of this patch, and shoutouts to trxbail, who pointed me toward a few fixes!

### Features and Fixes
* Replaced input system entirely with new, modern system using the SDL2 library
* Improved window handling allowing for custom resolutions and configurable windowing (NOTE: when using widescreen or portrait resolutions, the main menu is always forced to 4:3 using black bars to preserve the menu text's positioning)
* Replaced configuration files with new INI-based system (see partymod.ini)
* Custom configurator program to handle new configuration files
* Controller glyphs are now shown in prompts when using a controller. Controller glyph style is configurable between PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube style. Glyphs can be forced for keyboard players using the "prefer glyphs" setting NOTE: because of the way glyph code is rewritten in this version, some prompts will be incorrect
* Restores the on-screen keyboard
* Restores quick chat and keyboard taunt binds
* Adds entropy to music shuffling to make sure it doesn't repeat between sessions (while consuming the same number of random numbers)
* Fixes too-short clipping distance causing visual errors in large levels (I.E. Skatopia)
* Fixes screen flash effect covering only part of the screen (E.G. when doing a Franklin Grind)
* Optionally disables blur for graphics drivers that show severe artifacts
* Replaces online service with OpenSpy
* Movies now check for input every frame (as opposed to every five), making skipping much quicker
* Movies' aspect ratios are now respected, showing black bars when appropriate
* Cleanup code is now skipped on exit, so the game exits much faster

### Installation
1. Download PARTYMOD from the releases tab
2. Make sure THUG2 (English) is installed, remove the widescreen mod if it is installed (delete dinput8.dll)
3. Extract this zip folder into your THUG2 installation `game/` directory
4. Run partypatcher.exe to create the new, patched THUG2PM.exe game executable (this will be used to launch the game from now on) (this only needs to be done once)
5. Optionally (highly recommended), configure the game with partyconfig.exe
6. Launch the game from THUG2PM.exe

NOTE: if the game is installed into the "Program Files" directory, you may need to run each program as administrator. 
Also, if the game is installed into the "Program Files" directory, save files will be saved in the C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore directory.

### Building
The build requires CMake and SDL2 (I install it via vspkg).  Create the project file like so from the partymod-thps3/build directory:
```
cmake .. -A win32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/[vcpkg directory]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Set the optimization optimization for the partymod dll to O0 (disable optimization) because MSVC seems to break certain functions when optimization is enabled.
Additionally, set the SubSystem to "Windows (/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS)" in the partyconfig project.
